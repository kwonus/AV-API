AV-API is a C# dotnet 8 application.

However, there is a manager UI that is written in .NET 8 and WPF. The WPF App starts/stops the AV-API webapp using a Windows GUI. The AV-Bible-Addin-For-Microsoft-Word will reference the AV-Bible-API-Manager in the help files. As AV-API is a minimal WebApp, implemented as a loadable libary. Yet, the WPF App hosts the minimal web-server and grants user-level permissions to AppData folder. It also starts/stops the AV-API and show status of whether the AV-API is running or not. The Wpf App itself is stateless and single-instance (it can be closed without stopping the AV-API, and relaunched at will)
